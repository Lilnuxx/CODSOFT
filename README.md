CodSoft Mobile App Development Internship
During my 4-week internship at CodSoft, I gained hands-on experience in developing cross-platform mobile applications using the Flutter framework. As part of the program, I built two key projects:
1. Todo App
Developed a feature-rich Todo app
Key features include:
Intuitive UI with custom widgets and animations
Ability to add and delete tasks
Responsive design for both Android and iOS platforms

2. Quiz App
Designed and implemented a quiz application that tests users' knowledge on various topics.
Highlights of the app include:
Engaging UI with vibrant colors and smooth transitions

This internship has been instrumental in strengthening my expertise in cross-platform mobile development and solidifying my passion for creating innovative, user-centric applications.
